Hello!

Please use the home page to start the application.

Here is my submission for the iidentifii tech assessment.
I have completed the project in jQuery, using Bootstrap to aid with my styling.

I attempted the project in Vue but felt stuck so I decided to finish the project, 
to look as similar to the finished Vue product as possible.

I made my API calls using ajax.

My table was built dynamically using a for loop to iterate over the retured array of objects.

Once again, thank you for affording me this chance. If chosen for the position I assure you I will always give
my best to each and every task assigned to me and ensure I learn and improve each day.

Hello!

Please use the home page to start the application.

Here is my submission for the iidentifii tech assessment.
I have completed the project in jQuery, using Bootstrap to aid with my styling.

I made my API calls using ajax.

My table was built dynamically using a for loop to iterate over the retured array of objects.
